This webpage uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate, which is a static site generator that runs on the Ruby programming language.


## Installing Jekyll


**1. Install Ruby**

Ruby should come pre-installed on all OSX computers. You can check if Ruby is installed by running `ruby -v`.
If for some reason you're running a lower version, you can update.
```bash
$ sudo gem install ruby
```

**2. Install Bundler**

Bundler is a package manager that will aid you in installing all the Jekyll dependencies.
```bash
$ sudo gem install bundler
```

**3. Create Gemfile**

Create a directory, and add a file called `Gemfile`. In Terminal, run this command in the directory that contains the Gemfile.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

When it's finished, it will say something like this:
`Bundle complete! 1 Gemfile dependency, 55 gems now installed.`

**4. Serve**

The `distribution` folder is called `_site`. This is what the static site generator generates! Never place any files in that folder; they will be deleted and overwritten.
The `_sass` folder is for Sass partials. Every file in here should begin with an underscore, and it will compile into the css folder.

Using the following command to serve webpage

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```



## Configuration

In the main directory, there's a file called `_config.yml`.

Changes made to `_config.yml` will not be watched by jekyll serve. You must restart and reserve Jekyll after any config changes.
