I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences](https://eeps.rice.edu/) of Rice University, with the mentor of Prof. [Jonathan Ajo-Franklin](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/jonathan-ajo-franklin). 



My researches focus on seismology, including earthqauke sources, ambient noise monitoring and imaging. Recently interested in the combination with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (`DAS`) and `HPC` computing. I am also interested in uncertainty assessment of the seismic inversion, especially using `Bayesian Inference`.

I am an open-source lover interested in Python, C++, and Julia. `Cloud Computing` is my other recent interest.
